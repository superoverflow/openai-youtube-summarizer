    "transcript": "[Music] good morning everybody Welcome to the game plan my name is GTH Solway Chief Market strategist and Master Trader at verified investing.com and in themoney stock .c interesting morning today and we're going to talk a little bit about this before I do I just wanted to throw some balls right at you guys so there's a couple there coming at you hard and fast but bottom line is we have some Market action we've got to cover so before I do anything else let's walk over to this chart and discuss a little bit about what's going on so the kicker is this right and this is this is why I'm a little riled up today guys because literally we had Jerome Powell coming out two days ago and saying three rate hikes next year um inflation d d all this stuff well guess what literally like 15 minutes ago before this broadcast fed president Williams was on CNBC and he's talking the opposite he's walking back everything that Jerome Powell just said he said it's too early to talk about rate Cuts we're still going to be this we're still going to be strong we're going to do that you know everything that literally he said and I got to just throw at the camera right because this is just like so all of a sudden you had the Futures higher today right and basically we saw the Futures now starting to sell off because he's walking back everything that was just said it's really remarkable and I don't know what they're smoking there at the Federal Reserve or what their ultimate motives are obviously Jerome Powell carries the most weight right he's the FED president but my guess is that Jerome Powell was like wow you know I I really didn't know the markets would react so bullishly and we'd start hitting all-time highs on the Dow and get close on the NASDAQ and the S&P you know maybe you Fed chair fed fed President William should go out and talk it down a little bit and it's like dude like how do you not know that a pivot like that that literally surprised I mean I talked to Mike mlog Scott milker I mean I've talked to Big Wall Street play ERS this shocked us all and somehow it didn't register to him that it would have this reaction and now the markets are going up which is going to be inflationary right the wealth effect you look at your 401k holy cow I'm I'm I have all-time high money in my 401k and it's Christmas time you know what let me go out and buy that next you know this that next TV that next car whatever it is okay now the demand goes and we know inflation is a supply and demand side thing so when there's a a ton of demand then you create an issue where if there's not enough Supply prices go up right so again you know how this doesn't register I don't know I would love to know more about their inner thinking but again it is what it is my job here is to just let you know what's going on and we're going to get into the charts so without further delay yesterday we had a day where the NASDAQ 100 this is the NASDAQ 100 was down fractionally fractionally now are into a lot of levels of resistance in this General range right so again you can see how we have three trend lines coming all together one we're kind of right into the other one's a little bit above and the other one's just a little bit above there now if we look at this right and if we zoom out on this in fact in fact let's go to our weekly chart this is where these lines come from right so again we have a very steep one coming from this pivot low right through this point and right through these lines right there we have a secondary one here here all the way back to this level in March of 2020 and then we have the double top the all-time high on the QQQ so the q's again are very near resistance we are epically overbought if you look at the rsis as well I do think it's important to recognize that you do have some negative divergences okay so again just looking at some of these other ones here I want to just bring up RSI quickly and show you guys this but this does get my attention here all right so if we look at the RSI and I want to show you this Divergence the RSI continues to be all right so this was your high on the market this is where the RSI was look at the Market's making new highs RSI is making a lower high so again this doesn't by the way and there's your higher high this doesn't I want to be clear it doesn't tell us like today we're going to going to sell off and next week it gives us a general idea it says that there is a Divergence that is occurring a negative Divergence that at some point in the next let's say month you should have some sort of bigger rollover due to the Divergence here in the chart I wish it would give us an exact day a exact hour an exact minute but it just doesn't do that that's not how divergences work okay so just something there on that chart now if we flip over to the spiders and again let's take a look at the intraday here on the spiders let's go to the um extended hours and you can see basically by the way this is what went on and and it's not like by the way we only sold we were up on the markets going into pre-market we're basically flat now and you could see right here when Williams talked right here and put out his comments look at the market dip like that now we are floating back up just a little bit but the idea again is that this was a classic walk back this is a two-sided fed a Fed that says one thing then they watch the reaction and then they say the other thing and then if the reaction wasn't good they try to correct it and this is just something that we have to get used to as investors it's a little frustrating frankly because obviously there's millions of dollars trillions of dollars being gained and lost on these comments when it's just like dude Federal Reserve just tell us and stick with it like give us the bottom line essentially all right so anyways going back to the S&P 500 real quick here S&P daily is into a key level here if we go to our weekly chart I want to show you where this is we have a couple points of interest number one is right here to right here to right here secondary is this High here just below the all-time highs and then you do have a secondary line just above the all-time highs that would be your next point of interest but again one of the things I will point out guys and again this is methodology this is really important stuff to understand is you do have a time count in the weekly chart now now and the time counts and I will say this so I'm going to zoom in okay and this is really important stuff here so if you look at the zoomed in weekly chart of the SP the spiders or the cues there's eight straight weeks right one 2 3 four five six se seven weeks up the seven is a key time count in historic papers right it's something about sevens it appears over and over again look at your life you can see it in certain sevens coming together that frame you can look in the Bible you can look in any religious text seven repeats over and over again all right seven deadly sins the seven days of creation right creation and on the seventh day the rested um you know anything like that and again many of you guys know a lot more about that stuff than I but you'll notice sevens repeat over and over what we've discovered is that when you have a big move up on seven days the probabilities now again probabilities are not guarantees remember that but probabilities signal that on the next time you'll have some sort of down candle right you'll get some sort of selloff now it might be small you don't know but ultimately seven up candles probabilities favor a pullback by about an 80% margin if you look at this pattern over thousands and thousands of patterns okay so that's interesting to note the dollar today here or the 10e yield let's go to the 10-year yield you are getting a little bit of a bounce remember yesterday we talked about are we going to confirm the breakdown of the UPS sloping trend line as of now we are not but you don't know where this will end today even if we do there's a ton more support right down here on the chart just around that 3.85% so again you could go a little bit lower but ultimately we're right in the midst of another major support level on the 10year yield next up the dollar the dollar as you can imagine is getting a bounce today off of fed president Williams comments and again if we flip over to the US dollar it BAS basically kissed this next level of support right here and is now getting a little bit of a bounce again I ultimately think the dollar is going to go lower but I think it's again you know short term that's a massive massive move on the markets one little tidbit I want to just show you guys that I think is important is that if we go back to the 10-year yield here's the 10-year yield all right when did The Mark when did the 10year yield top out right basically late October right up here and it's been straight down all right now if we flip F over to the S&P 500 or the spiders okay and we go back to the daily chart and let's go back there okay when did the markets bottom out and the answer is very simple right in late October so do you guys see the inverse relationship so basically as soon as yields topped out that's when the markets bottomed out and began their rally to the upside now the question is is that at what point do we get a bounce in yields that kind of brings the market back in or or is it something else that eventually occurs we'll have to obviously find that out all right couple charts to go through I've talked about the bare flag on Microsoft as being very unusual considering how strong the markets have been notice yesterday what had started to happen even with an the NASDAQ was basically flat to negative the S&P was positive look at the bare flag right here and you're starting to break down all right so again if I'm looking at this chart where do I think this chart is going to actually retrace to I actually have some pretty good levels on here for where I think Microsoft is headed down to per this bare flag to do that I want to zoom out and basically take the lows going back all the way back down to the January period right what we're going to do is we're going to connect it through these pivot Points right here right so if we look at that and we look at this line right so you're looking at a level going all the way back to early 2023 through this level in March right it kisses right here it kisses right here and again right here that's also right around look at this high and this High that's right around that same general level around 340 to 345 so I would expect another $20 down over the next couple weeks maybe into January in Microsoft before it finds some major technical support for a bounce now $20 isn't a big move but again it is a three almost three trillion company so I guess $20 which would be what 6 7% something like that um decent move on it right that's not too shabby overall all right couple other charts guys uh broadcom which is symbol is avgo look at this guys this is a very good short in my opinion I am short myself on this stock and again the reasoning behind this is very simple you have your beautiful channel line if we look here at these lows down there it connects right through here and it connects the high of the highest point right there and look at what we just hit up there look at the extended move too incredible move on broadcom so my guess is you at least pull back to a th000 which is this High pivot best case if you're really looking for the big move you could go down to the channel line all the way down here but again in general you don't want to assume the bigger move you want to kind of take it within stride uh looking at the SMH which is the semis here I want to show you this trend line I actually think the semis are close to if not at a top here the reasoning is very simple again all about trend lines for me and extended moves if we take a look at this what do we have here pivot low Cuts right through here Cuts right through this High where we had the pullback right pullback pullback this was even a kind of a kiss the idea is you've just surged up you're right into there again the idea you should have some checkback off of that line all right so just something to kind of keep an eye on there on the SMH on a pullback Zone uh lastly I got to show you this chart here and then we'll get into a few other charts on bitcoin and commodities and so on and so forth but look at this chart on kbh so first of all rates are still high if you look at mortgage rates they're still 7 perish give or take even with this big drop that's still hugely higher than what most people are used to the housing market is not going to get better I mean yes there's going to be a few little blips a little pullback in rates some people will jump on on houses because they're like oh just pulled back a tiny bit I got to jump before it goes back up but overall people are struggling we're going to see jobs probably get worse and worse the job situation that's going to make it even harder for people and here look at this kbh look at this trend line from this high to this high and look at what we just hit up there the idea again guys is I just look at history and I look at these things and I say okay well if you pulled back like that there and you pulled back like that there and you're extended you've gone from $43 to $63 in a straight line what are the odds of us at least pulling back a little bit on that chart and for me the odds favor right I mean remember a swing Trader is looking to just get the odds in their favor because if you do a th Trad you just want to make sure you're winning better than 50% obviously if you use these methodology stuff that I teach it it turns out to be about 70 to 80% win rate but the idea is you're still going to lose on some some will be be you know crazy right I mean natural gas was a great one we're going to talk about that though because n gas is actually doing all right the last couple days but again not everything's going to be perfect it's all about the bigger picture and the more trades when it's all averaged out where are you on your level speaking of levels guys I do want to just mention that lux algo has been awesome

description below and sign up for Lux algo today all right guys we're back couple things so on to Natural Gas to me so far so good with that final level of support what I mean by that guys is check this out so remember the level of support which was down here from the 2020 lows all the way here and we just tagged it over here now what's positive about this number one you've bounced thus far which is good but what I'm keeping an eye on very closely here is are we going to get a bottoming tail on the weekly chart bottoming tails are reversal signals to the upside topping tails are reversal signals to the downside if I zoom in on this chart and we zoom in a lot right so we have to zoom in all the way in what I'm seeing right here again oversold and again this is the weekly chart of natural gas look at the tail right at that trend line and look at where we are the key to a bottoming tail is that you need the close of this candle to be in the top 25% of the entire length of that candle from the absolute High to the absolute low if we get that the probability favor a bottom in near term at least in natural gas and a reversal back to the upside so that's what I'm going to watch here folks again I don't have an exact level but I'm going to guess it's going to be around $240 maybe 41 cents on this chart we've been even up there pre-market here we're just chopping around but that is good to see and again natural gas I continue to like I think it's gotten way too beaten down I don't know if this is you know maneuvering for options expiration which is today or what not but I do think natural gas is going to start to move back up you can see the last couple days here right the last couple days we actually have had a bounce on natural gas uh Bitcoin Bitcoin just continuing to chop around here folks there's not a whole lot for me to give you updates on bitcoin uh again we've talked about how you had this move up this was the beginnings of a bull flag then it failed then you started a bare flag then that failed now you're just going here but now it looks like it's failing here and basically when you get get this type of action as a technician you can't try to make a mountain out of a mole hill you just have to say listen it's a chop shop that's what it is and so what you want to do is you want to then say okay well what does that mean well basically what you can do is you can draw a trend line like this right and then take this and do a trend line down like this and essentially and it's not the perfect the greatest of wedge patterns I just drew but essentially that's what is becoming now you're just getting a lot of this chop in here right which is now just consolidation and the question remains do we break to the upside or do we break to the downside upside break you retest the highs here at around 44 to 45,000 if that breaks you go to 48 to 50 which is my Max move on bitcoin um in the near term at least and if you break to the downside we know where support is right you have this level and this level they're both converging we can just extend those out here and it basically gives us $38,000 Target to the downside so that would be basically your support resistance now again you might say hey well what about in 6 months from now what about in a year where's Bitcoin those I obviously I have my own perceptions on but the shortest and this is going to be important folks the shortest predictions are going to be the most accurate and the reason they're so accurate and again if you look at my short-term like day trading track record 95% right swing trading track record at 80% if you look at my longer term projections that's where it probably gets toward like 60 65% and the concept is this is that the longer you hold a trade or you're looking out in terms of distance you know what happens you have more variables that can change like for instance you know over the last few years Russia invaded Ukraine Hamas struck Israel and created this now war between Hamas and Israel right I mean there's lots of different things that we just don't know right Co you know how many people went in you know 6 months ahead of even it it hitting China and was like oh that next year we're going to have this monster flush and then this massive Bull Run almost no one right cuz no one could predict that because it was so far out so always remember that the short-term predictions are going to be the most accurate because you're basically have the least amount of time where something can adjust in the charts versus the long term and that's a good you know like and this is the thing guys everyone's asking me right like I mean I go on all these interviews and all these other things and they're like oh you know where do you see gold by the end of 2024 where do you see Bitcoin by the end of 2024 and I give my opinion right but in reality the odds of that being correct are much much lower than something like KB's chart which which we're looking for a pullback in the next one week period right that's a very short-term boom type thing um and and same thing with natural gas right natural gas if it puts in a bottoming tail for the next couple weeks you're bullish on natural gas who the heck knows where natural gas is in 12 months from now right right I certainly don't okay I just want to make that clear because I think that's a really important thing to grasp when you're talking about charting and that goes for everyone everyone's getting asked all the analysts all the Talking Heads all the influencers are giving their opinion for the whole next year the accuracy level is going to be like this it's just the nature of it okay couple other things here guys on the charts let's quickly go over gold gold had is having a pause day thus far so gold again nothing going on here again if we start to make bullish consolidation on this so if we again nice push bullish then you start to reack this high and this High I do think that is going to happen I think again the fear will come back that will be a driver for gold and I think ultimately like I said we'll get bounces in the dollar but I think the dollar eventually goes lower as well couple other charts to quickly go over here uh silver not much going on here this was a great call from earlier this week guys I again I I saw so many of you guys took this and said you bought calls on SL V or you bought SLV or whatever but look at that move up here now same thing we're looking to see if we consolidate here and build up for that next move up and then oil it did again achieve its Target of the head and shoulders right target here to here right and that just mapped out perfectly from here again this is something I teach in the winning Trader series and look at that right down to those levels and starting to bounce I actually think oil could actually continue to bounce maybe back up to about $78 before it finally runs out of steam and then lastly we can check in on the vix guys the vix for the most part not much doing here we're still in the low ranges around $12.26 still historically this is ridiculously low there's so much complacency in the market again the more complacency the more people think that it's the no-brainer to be long the market it's the same is when we were at 68 69,000 on bitcoin and everyone was saying I mean literally I would go on Twitter and it was like 100,000 by the end of November 250,000 by the end of December like I mean it was just like everyone was just banking on it and that always concerns me when everyone's in One Direction you want to be careful you want to be a little bit more conservative and when it's mixed you got to just kind of do your own research and when it's very much the other way just flip it around and go back and forth again sentiment is a big indicator in the markets all right back to here guys so again as we come into the end of this broadcast this is Friday I do have an announcement next week I am away on vacation so unfortunately there'll be no game plans next week but that's okay because I will come back after next week the day after Christmas so Christmas will
